This story is about a Lederhose wearing man named Karl, they were the rightful heir to the Schloss Eltz.
Employed at a Biergarten and earning a wettbewerbsfaehig wage, Karl now has a Schloss and knows he has it made.
So he purchased a BMW and headed to the Flughafen planning to travel and celebrate.
Karl stopped for a Bratwurst and Apfelkuchen on the way.
As he enjoyed his food and fair weather, a Porsche crashed into his BMW.
Strangly, the driver of the Porsche was a Hund who wanted Karl's food, the Hund barked listening to his favorite Rammstein album.
Since Karl lost his food and car, he walked down the Hauptstrasse to find a Ratskeller,to drink his bad day away.
As Karl entered the ratskeller he found that it was a combination baekerei and biergarten with the most delectable brot.
The biergarten's services were exquisite, but Karl spilled some of his kolsch on his lederhose and moved closer to the Klimaanlage to dry them.
But to as he was drying of his lederhose he noticed that the hund wast here aswell looking for some Gebaeck.
At the Klimaanlage Karl met a wettbewerbsfaehig hund who offered to play a game of cards in exchange for Gebaeck.
Karl was feeling a little wettbewerbsfaehig himself, so he said "I will play, but only if the Gebaeck is Apfelkuchen."
After the card game karl walked home, the next day he woke up wearing a Dirndel, and a box of Gebaeck.
With a calm disposition and authoritative tone, the Hund demanded Karl's food, but Karl informed the Hund that there is a Backerei about 1 km down the street where cheap Brot are sold.
